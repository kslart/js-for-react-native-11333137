## Description of Tasks

### Task 1: Create arrayManipulation.js and processArray Function
- Developed a JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js`.
- Implemented the `processArray` function that processes an array of numbers by squaring each even number and tripling each odd number, returning a new array with the results.

### Task 2: Add formatArrayStrings Function
- Added the `formatArrayStrings` function to `arrayManipulation.js`.
- This function takes two arrays: one of strings and one of numbers processed by `processArray`.
- It modifies each string according to the corresponding number: strings are capitalized if the number is even and converted to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3: Create userInfo.js and createUserProfiles Function
- Created a new JavaScript file called `userInfo.js`.
- Defined the `createUserProfiles` function which accepts an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
- The function returns an array of objects, each containing the `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and an `id` that auto-increments starting from 1.
